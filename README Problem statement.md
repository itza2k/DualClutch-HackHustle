## PROBLEM STATEMENT - 2

# AI-Driven Dynamic Public Transportation Scheduler

Efficiently managing public transportation in urban areas is a significant challenge, especially with fluctuating commuter demand, traffic variations, and unexpected events. This project aims to develop an AI-driven platform that autonomously schedules and dispatches public transport vehicles, ensuring dynamic adaptability and optimized efficiency.

## Problem Statement

As urban populations grow, managing public transportation to meet dynamic demand becomes more complex. Traditional scheduling systems often struggle to adapt to real-time fluctuations in commuter demand, traffic conditions, or unscheduled events like concerts, sports matches, and road closures. This can result in:

- Overcrowded buses or trains.
- Under-utilized vehicles.
- Longer commute times and delays.

These inefficiencies impact both commuters and transportation authorities, necessitating an intelligent, adaptive system for real-time scheduling and routing.

## Solution Overview

### Deliverables

Develop an AI-based platform that autonomously manages the scheduling, routing, and dispatching of public transportation vehicles (buses, trains, etc.) based on real-time data and predictive insights. The system should:

- **Predict Commuter Demand:** Leverage historical and live data to forecast demand across routes.
- **Adapt Scheduling in Real-Time:** Respond to live traffic conditions and events by dynamically adjusting schedules.
- **Optimize Routing and Dispatching:** Minimize congestion, reduce wait times, and balance vehicle utilization.

### Objectives

1. **Real-Time Commuter Demand Prediction**
   - Use AI/ML algorithms to predict commuter demand based on historical patterns, seasonal trends, and real-time data (e.g., weather, local events, traffic data).
2. **Dynamic Scheduling and Routing**
   - Continuously adapt transport schedules and routes in response to live traffic conditions and known events (e.g., concerts, sporting events, road closures).
3. **Optimization of Dispatching**
   - Maximize vehicle utilization by balancing commuter loads, reducing underutilized runs, and minimizing commuter wait times.
   - Reduce congestion and ensure equitable coverage across urban regions.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Incorporates traffic data, commuter density, and event information to make data-driven decisions.
- **Predictive Analytics for Demand Forecasting:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate demand predictions.
- **Adaptive Scheduling & Routing:** Uses AI algorithms to adjust vehicle deployment and routes dynamically.
- **Event Awareness:** Automatically adjusts based on both scheduled (e.g., concerts) and unexpected events (e.g., road closures).
- **Optimization Engine:** Ensures optimal vehicle dispatching to balance demand and minimize commuter wait times.
